# Hodgkin-Huxley-Model
## Overview
The **Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) model** is a fundamental biophysical framework used for simulating neuronal excitability, where neurons generate action potentials through voltage-gated ion channels, closely mimicking the electrophysiological dynamics of biological neurons.<br>

The above simulation captures the essential **electrophysiological behavior** of neurons and generates two key visualizations:<br>
the **Membrane Potential Plot**, which illustrates the evolution of voltage over time, and <br> 
the **Gating Variable Plot**, which represents the dynamics of ion channel activation and inactivation.<br>
